# Automate Infrastructure With IaC using Terraform. Part 3 â€“ Refactoring #

Project 18 is a contunation of project 17, the entire code is refactored inorder to simplify the code using a Terraform tool called Module.

The following outlines detailed step taken to achieve this:

# Step 1: Configuring A Backend On The S3 Bucket #

Create a file and name it backend.tf. Add the code found below :
```
# Note: The bucket name may not work for you since buckets are unique globally in AWS, so you must give it a unique name.
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "terraform_state" {
  bucket = "opeyemi-dev-terraform-bucket"
  # Enable versioning so we can see the full revision history of our state files
  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
  # Enable server-side encryption by default
  server_side_encryption_configuration {
    rule {
      apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
        sse_algorithm = "AES256"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Add the code found below which creates a DynamoDB table to handle locks and perform consistency checks:

```
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "terraform_locks" {
  name         = "terraform-locks"
  billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key     = "LockID"
  attribute {
    name = "LockID"
    type = "S"
  }
}
```

Terraform expects that both S3 bucket and DynamoDB resources are already created before we configure the backend. So, let us run terraform apply to provision resources.

Enter the code found below to configure the backend
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "opeyemi-dev-terraform-bucket"
    key            = "global/s3/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```
